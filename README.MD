# Azure Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I have written to simplify working with Azure.

## Usage

You will need to [ensure that you have the Az module installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-5.0.0) and run the `Connect-AzAccount` command in your shell prior to executing anything.
